* How workerRoom maintain connections between master and workers
WorkerRoom divide two sets of workers, one of two is collection of workers that
in online state and another one is collection of workers that in offline state.

When a new worker is connect to master it will be accepted and it will be stored
into online set.

If an online worker is lost then it will set to WAITING state and move to offline
set.If the worker is reconnect in WAITING_INTERVAL then it will comeback to online
set otherwise it will be removed from WorkerRoom.

Note: Information on worker that decide to remove will be deal by hooks that register
      by another modules.
